# MultitreadingExample
OOP Homework that I hope teaches me about multithreading

### Problem 1

* Create **n** threads, each sleeps for a random amount of time between 1 and 10 seconds, then displays its sleep time and exits.
* Prompt the user to input n.

### Problem 2

* Solve a cross tunnel problem using priority mechanism. 
* There are 10 people who wants to go through a tunnel.
* Each time only one person can go through the tunnel and it takes 5 seconds (using **sleep()** to simulate). When one person has crossed, he/she prints the name out.
* The priority is determined alphabetically (e.g., a person named "abc" has a priority higher than "xyz").
* Create 10 people with randomly generated names, and let them go through a tunnel.
